# ytMp3dl
When someone asks if I have a yt to mp3 downloader I will send them this

Install with: python -m venv venv && venv\Scripts\activate && pip install yt-dlp && pip install requests        
Then run the .py file

I made it pretty easy to use I think so just run it or run from command line with -h for more help.     
Help me out by reporting bugs in the issues section      
The program will install ffmpeg when run if not already found, total file size 410 mb
